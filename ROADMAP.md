# Bazaar Tracker - Roadmap

Active work tracker. Project context, architecture, and stable design notes live in `CLAUDE.md`.

Status labels:
- `Done`: implemented and expected to stay closed.
- `Implemented - verify live`: code exists, but needs confirmation on one or more real runs.
- `Partial`: useful foundation exists, but the feature is not complete enough to close.
- `Open`: not yet implemented.
- `Deprioritized`: low priority feature, leaving as a potential enhancement.

## Open Feature Work

### Multi-Hero Support - Partial

Goal: add more heroes while keeping existing Karnok/Mak behavior stable.

Relevant files:
- `<hero>_builds.json` files
- `scorer.py`
- `web/build_helpers.py`
- `web/overlay_state.py`
- `capture_mono.py` and `msgpack_decoder.py` hero enum mappings

Implementation notes:
- Add one hero at a time as a new build JSON catalog.
- Keep build schema compatible with existing `game_phases`, `archetypes`, `scoring_weights`, and `timing_profile` fields.
- Make sure new hero names match the names emitted by Mono capture and stored on `runs.hero`.

How to test:
- Start a run on the new hero and confirm `runs.hero` is correct in SQLite.
- Verify `scorer.py` loads the new catalog instead of falling back to no-score behavior.
- Verify overlay Coach tab displays the new hero's archetypes and condition items.

### Event Choice Scoring - Deprioritized

Goal: rank map node / encounter decisions relative to build direction instead of only recording that a map node was chosen.

Relevant files:
- `run_state.py`
- `parser.py`
- `scorer.py`
- `web/review_builder.py`
- `web/static/index.html`
- `web/static/overlay.html`

Implementation notes:
- Identify the available event/map options in the log or Mono payload, not only the chosen node.
- Store offered event choices in `decisions.offered` and selected choice in `chosen_id` / `chosen_name` shape compatible with existing review code.
- Extend `scorer.py` to score event choices using phase, current board, current archetype, gold/health, and likely rewards.
- Keep event-choice scoring separate from normal item scoring so event rewards are not mislabeled as shop mistakes.

How to test:
- Capture a run with multiple event/map choices.
- Confirm the DB has `decision_type='event_choice'` rows with both offered and chosen data.
- Confirm dashboard/review show the event choice with a useful note.
- Confirm normal event loot/free reward rows are still excluded from suboptimal shop scoring.

### Add Card Images - Partial

Goal: improve image coverage beyond the currently partial manifest.

Relevant files:
- `extract_bazaar_bundle_pngs.py`
- `probe_bundle_coverage.py`
- `probe_install_card_bundle.py`
- `web/card_images.py`
- `web/server.py`
- `web/review_builder.py`
- `web/static/overlay.html`
- `static_cache/images/manifest.json`

Current state:
- `extract_bazaar_bundle_pngs.py` can export card-looking `Texture2D` assets and write a manifest.
- `web/card_images.py` loads `static_cache/images/manifest.json`.
- `web/server.py` serves card images through `/cards/<filename>`.
- Review/overlay code can attach image URLs when manifest entries exist.
- Images do not appear to be complete. Some have large black portions in the image like something is missing.
    * likely some type of building happens and thats how enhancements look different. We need to build the "default" non enhanced image
- Coverage currently at ~80%

Implementation notes:
- Use `probe_install_card_bundle.py` against representative bundles to inspect `Texture2D`, `Sprite`, atlas, and container path relationships.
- Update extractor to follow Sprite-to-Texture references and export sprite crops if full card art is packed into atlases.
- Keep the manifest keyed by normalized card name so `web/card_images.py` does not need to know Unity internals.
- Add coverage reporting: total card names from `card_cache` vs manifest hits.
- Add aliases in `web/card_images.py` only for true naming mismatches, not missing extraction logic.

How to test:
- Run image extraction against both user-data Addressables cache and Steam install bundles.
- Confirm `static_cache/images/manifest.json` has increased entry count and no stale entries.
- Start `python tracker.py --no-mono`, open dashboard/overlay, and confirm cards with manifest entries render through `/cards/<filename>`.
- Spot-check missing common cards and use probe scripts to determine whether they are atlas sprites, generated textures, or naming mismatches.
