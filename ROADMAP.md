# Bazaar Tracker - Roadmap

Active work tracker. Project context, architecture, and stable design notes live in `CLAUDE.md`.

Status labels:
- `Partial`: useful foundation exists, but the feature is not complete enough to close.
- `Open`: not yet implemented.
- `On Hold`: blocked on an external dependency or prerequisite.

## Open Feature Work

### Multi-Hero Support - On Hold

Goal: add Jules and Stelle hero catalogs while keeping existing Karnok/Mak/Dooley/Vanessa/Pygmalien behavior stable.

Status: Karnok, Mak, Dooley, Vanessa, and Pygmalien have populated catalogs. Jules and Stelle are on hold — not yet purchased.

Relevant files:
- `<hero>_builds.json` files
- `scorer.py`
- `web/build_helpers.py`
- `web/overlay_state.py`
- `capture_mono.py` and `msgpack_decoder.py` hero enum mappings

Implementation notes:
- Add one hero at a time as a new build JSON catalog.
- Keep build schema compatible with existing `game_phases`, `archetypes`, `scoring_weights`, and `timing_profile` fields.
- Make sure new hero names match the names emitted by Mono capture and stored on `runs.hero`.
- Use the enricher fetch + compare workflow to populate initial archetypes before writing the catalog.

How to test:
- Start a run on the new hero and confirm `runs.hero` is correct in SQLite.
- Verify `scorer.py` loads the new catalog instead of falling back to no-score behavior.
- Verify overlay Coach tab displays the new hero's archetypes and condition items.

### Build Archetype Images - Open

Goal: show a single representative image per build archetype in the overlay/dashboard rather than attempting per-card inline images. Drop the per-card image pipeline.

Relevant files:
- `<hero>_builds.json` — add optional `image` field per archetype
- `web/build_helpers.py` — expose image field when loading archetypes
- `web/static/overlay.html` — render archetype image in Coach tab
- `web/static/index.html` — render archetype image in dashboard build section

Direction:
- Each archetype entry in `*_builds.json` gets an optional `image` field (URL or local filename).
- Images can be sourced manually (curator picks one representative card art or build screenshot) or downloaded automatically during `refresh-content` / `update-builds`.
- Downloaded images are stored in `static_cache/images/builds/` — keyed by hero + archetype slug.
- Overlay Coach tab shows the archetype image (or a placeholder) alongside the archetype name and checklist.
- Remove inline per-card image rendering from review/overlay once build images are in place. Existing `web/card_images.py`, manifest, and extraction scripts can be archived or deleted once this replaces them.
- BazaarDB outreach is still open — if they respond, their images could be used as the source for archetype art.

Implementation notes:
- Keep it simple: one image per archetype, not per card. No manifest, no quality diagnostics.
- Image field is optional — archetypes without one just show no image (no fallback chain needed).
- If downloading during refresh: respect rate limits, store locally, never rehost.

How to test:
- Add an `image` field to one archetype in `karnok_builds.json` and confirm overlay Coach tab renders it.
- Confirm archetypes without an image field display cleanly with no broken-image placeholder.
- If auto-download is implemented, run `refresh-content` and confirm images land in `static_cache/images/builds/`.
